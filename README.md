# Make vs. Buy Decision Analysis

## Project Objective:
To analyze the cost of make vs. buy options for Tenate Industries, a company selling replacement parts for industrial pizza ovens, using provided data tables and quotes from suppliers.

## Data Sources & Queries:
-	Data Source: Data tables containing information about part numbers, supplier quotes, production costs, and other relevant factors.
-	Key Queries:
    - Total cost of making vs. buying each part
    - Cost breakdown by component for both make and buy options
    - Sensitivity analysis of cost factors (e.g., labor, material costs)
    - Comparison of supplier quotes and in-house production costs

## Power BI Tools:
- Get Data: Import the data tables into Power BI using the appropriate connector.
- Power Query Editor: Clean, transform, and prepare the data for analysis.
- Visualizations:
   - Stacked Bar Charts: To compare the cost breakdown of make vs. buy options.
   - Stacked Column Charts: To analyze the cost of different components for make and buy.
   - Line Charts: To visualize the sensitivity of costs to changes in variables.
   - Clustered Column Chart: To compare supplier quotes and in-house production costs.
- Interactivity:
  - Slicers: To filter data based on part numbers, suppliers, or other criteria.
  - Card: To display key metrics (e.g., total cost difference).
  - Tables: To view detailed cost information.
  - Filtering: To drill down into specific parts or suppliers.
  - Format Pane: To customize the appearance of visualizations.

## Data Set Used:
<a href="https://github.com/Simran0721/Supply-Chain-Analytics-for-Tenate-Industries/blob/main/Fictitious%20RFP%20Responses%20for%20Make%20vs%20Buy.xlsx">DataSet</a>

Data tables containing information about part numbers, supplier quotes, production costs, and other relevant factors.

## Questions (KPIs):
- Cost difference: Varies by part, with some parts significantly cheaper to buy.
- Cost breakdown: Make has higher labor costs, buy has higher material costs.
- Key factors: Volume, supplier quotes, in-house capabilities influence cost.
- Make vs. buy: Parts with high production costs and low supplier quotes should be bought, while others can be made in-house.

## Process:
1.	Data Acquisition: Obtain the data tables containing relevant information.
2.	Data Cleaning and Preparation: Clean and preprocess the data using Power Query Editor.
3.	Data Analysis: Perform data analysis to calculate costs, compare options, and identify key factors.
4.	Visualization: Create visualizations to represent the findings in a clear and concise manner.
5.	Insight Generation: Draw conclusions and generate insights based on the analysis.
6.	Recommendation: Provide recommendations for Tenate Industries on the make vs. buy decisions.

## Project Insight:
-	The project will help Tenate Industries make informed decisions about which parts to produce in-house and which to purchase from suppliers.
-	By analyzing the cost differences and identifying key factors, the company can optimize its supply chain and reduce costs.

## Final Conclusion:
-	The project successfully provides valuable insights into the make vs. buy decision for Tenate Industries.
-	The findings can be used to optimize the company's supply chain and improve profitability.
-	The interactive Power BI dashboard allows for easy exploration and analysis of the data.
